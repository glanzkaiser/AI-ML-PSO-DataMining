# AI-ML-PSO-DataMining
Compilation of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Particle Swarm Optimization codes and learning

# What Inside this Repository?
A lot of codes(in Python and MATLAB) and explanation for learning about :
1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Machine Learning
3. Particle Swarm Optimization
4. Data Mining

Special thanks to Chrisselda Marito Dayana who helped me create the "Matlab Codes and Explanation section". 

# To-do Lists
1. Create a structured book while re-learning AI-ML-PSO and Data Mining after finish Hamzstlab, Lasthrim Projection and GFreya OS, while also create Mischkra, Nagiconomy, and the rest of 10 STEM Books
2. Use Julia or low level language like C/C++
3. Apply the algorithm to Physics SDK like Bullet, Project Chrono, Box2D
4. Do all of the aboves with Freya and Lasthrim
